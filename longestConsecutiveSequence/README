128. Longest Consecutive Sequence 4/3

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example,
Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

use a map to keep track of the lowest node, length pair and the highest node, lenght pair. 

initially, a new node will be added into the map with length 1
then, if node - 1 and/or node + 1 is in the map, compute the length and update lowest node, length pair and highest node, length pair
