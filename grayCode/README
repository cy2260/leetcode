89. Gray Code  4/2

The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:

00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2
Note:
For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.

For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.

For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.

By definition
n = 0: 0
n = 1: 0, 1
n = 2: 00, 01, 11, 10
n = 3: 000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100

n = k: reverse results of n=k-1 and for each elem | 1 << k-1, and append to the results of n=k-1
example, 10 | 1<<2 = 110, 11 | 1<<2 = 111, 01 | 1<<2 = 101, 00 | 1<<2 100
