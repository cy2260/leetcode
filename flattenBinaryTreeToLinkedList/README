114 Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List 3/3

Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example,
Given

         1
        / \
       2   5
      / \   \
     3   4   6

The flattened tree should look like:
   1
    \
     2
      \
       3
        \
         4
          \
           5
            \
             6


move left subtree to right subtree, and then process right subtree
