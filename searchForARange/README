34. Search for a Range 4/3

Given a sorted array of integers, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

For example,
Given [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10] and target value 8,
return [3, 4].

1 binary search find if target is in the array, then linear search lower and upper bound.
2 binary search to find the lower and upper bound.
