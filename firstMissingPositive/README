41. First Missing Positive 5/2
41. First Missing Positive 5/2
Given an unsorted integer array, find the first missing positive integer.

For example,
Given [1,2,0] return 3,
and [3,4,-1,1] return 2.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant space.

sort and find, O(nlogn)
hash table and find, O(n), space complexity O(n)

value of first missing positive should be in range [1, n) given n elem array
in the first iteration, swap A[i] with with A[A[i]-1], 
	if A[i] is in range [1,n)
	if A[i] != A[A[i]-1]
	if i != A[i]-1;
in the second iteration, if A[i] != i+1, then i+1
                         if A[i] == i+1 satisfied in the loop, then return n;

example [1, 4, 2, 4, 8]
skip A[0], b/c A[0]-1 == 0;
skip A[1], b/c A[1] == A[A[1]-1]
result 1, 2, 4, 4, 8
