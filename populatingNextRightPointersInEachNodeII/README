117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II 4/2

Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".

What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?

Note:

You may only use constant extra space.
For example,
Given the following binary tree,

         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \    \
    4   5    7
After calling your function, the tree should look like:

         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \    \
    4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL

       1
      / \
     2   3
    /   / \
   4   5   6
  /       / \
 7       8   9

 dfs
 need to connect right tree first b/c it is not a perfect balance tree
 5 need to link to 6 in order for 7 to connect to 8
 if connect left subtree first it will fail
