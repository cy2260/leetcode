124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum 4/2
Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

The path may start and end at any node in the tree.

For example:
Given the below binary tree,

       1
      / \
     2   3
Return 6.

       1
      / \
     -2 -1
Return 1.

      Node
     /    \
   L-sub  R-sub
   /  \   /  \
  ..  .. ..  ..

for each root node, there are 4 possible paths:
1. only root node, if sums of both subtrees are negative
2. left + root + right, if sums of both subrees are positive
3. left + root, if sum of right subtree is negative
4. root + right, if sum of left subtree is negative
